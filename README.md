# Objective ðŸŽ¯

Polish your digital CV with the box model. Adjusting the widths, heights, and shapes to enhance the layout. Elevate readability by introducing spaces between elements and distinctly separating sections, ensuring your digital CV is easily digestible.

P.S. This is a free-format exercise, allowing your creativity to shine. However, we still provide examples to guide you.

# Requirements ðŸ“‹

1. **Utilizing the Box Model**: Enrich your layout using classes as selectors. At a minimum:
    - Use border-box in all elements.
    - Add margin, padding, and border to the body. Observe the behavior.
    - Make the profile picture rounded, and add a border.
    - Separate sections with margins to utilize collapsing margins. Also, use borders to space them apart. Observe the behavior.
    - Apply padding below headers to provide spacing and ensure content doesn't feel cramped.
    - Adjust form elements to capture the same look and feel.
    - Remove outlines from form elements, ensuring a cleaner look.
2. **Using Comments**: As before, annotate your CSS with comments for clarity and context.
